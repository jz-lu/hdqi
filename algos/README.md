# Optimization Algorithms

This folder contains algorithms to attack the Hamiltonian optimization problems. To use it, first generate instances in the `construction` folder.

The attacks include:
1. Hamiltonian DQI using belief propagation (hDQI+BP) decoding
2. Simulated annealing
3. **TODO**: add all the attacks we use
