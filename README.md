# hdqi

This repository contains the code and data used in the numerical study of Hamiltonian DQI (hDQI). 
It is organized into two folders. `construction` gives the algorithms which construct the 
Hamiltonian instances to be optimized, and `algos` contains all the algorithms
used to attack the Hamiltonian optimization problem. This includes hDQI+BP, simulated annealing, etc.

## Dependencies
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* **TODO**: add rest of dependencies
